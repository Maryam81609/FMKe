# FMK Application

FMK-- is a prototype application that serves as a use case for the [Antidote key-value store][3], which was built for the [SyncFree project][2].

## Dependencies

FMK-- uses rebar3 to build releases and tests, and a local installation is provided in order to make the application start straight away. It also assumes that there is available access to a local Antidote node.
